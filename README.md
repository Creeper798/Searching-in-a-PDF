English Quote Searcher:

This program was created by Creeper_798 to be used in an English 11 class. 
The purpose of the program is to make searching for quotes and words in a PDF easier and faster. 
I've been working on fixing bugs. (Known bugs listed below).
The program was made entirely using the Python 3.6 programming language.
The code may run slowly, especially on slow computers because the search function looks at every page of the PDF.


Adding More PDFs:

As long as the PDF's have different names, you can have as many as you want in the main folder.
The program will ask you for the name of the PDF, make sure you don't add the .pdf extension, the program will do this automatically.
If anything other than the exact name of the PDF is entered an error will show up and the program will end.
Because of this, I try to rename PDF's to an easier title (Ex. The Great Gatsby to TGG, Fahrenheit 451 to 451)


Known Bugs:

 - [FIXED] Search only finds the word once per page before moving on to the next page.

 - [FIXED] PDF formatting makes certain words not show up when searched for, and quotes show up weird.

 - [FIXED] "Word not found" shows up if the word is on the first page of the PDF.

 - [FIXED] It's not saying "Word not found" when a word isn't found... (I don't even know why I kept this feature...)

 - [FIXED?] The program sometimes crashes for no reason. ¯\_(._.)_/¯

 - [FIXED] Searching for the words "end", "and", "the", or "ass" ends the program... :I (Yes, I searched ass to test this.)

 - [FIXED] Searching skips every other page.

 - [FIXED] It literally just lost all functionality after version 6, working on fixing it.


To Do List:

 - [] Make program compatible with accepting PDF URLs.

 - [DONE] Fix the one word per page bug

 - [DONE] Maybe have it ask what the title of the PDF is instead of having it set to 451 by default. (Simple fix, but not needed??)

 - [DONE] Find a fix for PDF formatting.

 - [DONE] Fix the entire program not working after version 6 update.

 - [DONE] Fix the every other page glitch.

 - [DONE] Fix the "Word not found" command.

 - [DONE] Maybe add quotation marks around the quotes for the super lazy people.

 - [DONE] Add spacing between the "Would you like to search for another word?" and the next quote that comes up.

 - [DONE] Change while (pages < numpages) to while (pages != numpages)

 - [DONE] Try x += 1 instead of x = x + 1
